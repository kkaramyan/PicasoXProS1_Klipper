# PicasoXProS1_Klipper
Picaso designer X Pro S1 3D printer conversion from proprietary to Klipper operating environment.

This project describes how to convert Picaso designer X Pro S1 3D printer from proprietary to Klipper operating environment.
Picaso designer X Pro is dualexruder switching printhead 3D printer.
On current stage I'm publishing here Klipper configuration files of project.

Later, sequentially, I am planning to publish other parts of project, like:
- BOM;
- STL files for printed parts;
- Passthrough board schematics;
- Wiring table;
